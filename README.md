# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```

Step-by-Step Guide
1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
2. Install Dependencies
Install project dependencies using npm:

bash
Copy code
npm install
3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

plaintext
Copy code
PRIVATE_KEY=<your-private-key>
ALCHEMY_API_KEY=<your-alchemy-api-key>
Replace <your-private-key> with your Ethereum wallet private key and <your-alchemy-api-key> with your Alchemy API key.

4. Compile Smart Contracts
Compile the Solidity smart contracts using Hardhat:

bash
Copy code
npx hardhat compile
5. Deploy the Contract
Deploy the CreditScore contract to an Ethereum network (e.g., Rinkeby, Mainnet):

bash
Copy code
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
Replace <network-name> with your desired network.

6. Test the Smart Contracts
Run unit tests to verify the functionality of the CreditScore contract:

bash
Copy code
npx hardhat test
7. Start the API Server
Launch the Node.js API server to interact with the deployed CreditScore contract:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The API server will run locally on port 3000 by default.

8. Integrate External Data
Update user credit scores with external data using the integration script:

bash
Copy code
node scripts/integrateExternalData.js
Ensure your environment variables (PRIVATE_KEY, ALCHEMY_API_KEY) are correctly configured for network and API connectivity.
